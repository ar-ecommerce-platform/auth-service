## ðŸªœ Phase 1 â€” Internal Auth MVP (Self-Hosted)

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Establish the foundation for authentication inside the platform.

Implement:
- Local username/password registration and login
- JWT token generation and validation
- Basic endpoint protection via Spring Security

This phase ensures all microservices can authenticate and verify users before adding external complexity.

### ðŸ”§ Core Deliverables
| Component | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| `/auth/register` | Register users with hashed passwords |
| `/auth/login` | Authenticate users and issue JWTs |
| `/auth/validate` | Validate existing tokens |
| `SecurityConfig` | Configures HTTP security, JWT filter, password encoder |
| `JwtService` | Generates and verifies tokens |

### ðŸ§© Output
A fully functional self-hosted auth system with stateless JWT authentication.

## ðŸªœ Phase 2 â€” Token Hardening

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Add refresh token support and strengthen session management.

At this stage, the system evolves from a basic token issuer into a **secure token lifecycle manager**.

### ðŸ”§ Core Deliverables
| Component | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| `TokenService` | Handles refresh token creation, rotation, and revocation |
| `RedisConfig` | Enables caching and blacklisting of revoked tokens |
| `/auth/refresh` | Endpoint for refreshing access tokens |

### ðŸ§© Output
Short-lived access tokens + long-lived refresh tokens stored securely and invalidated when revoked.

---

## ðŸªœ Phase 3 â€” External IdP (Hybrid)

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Integrate **external identity providers** (Google, Okta, etc.) for hybrid authentication.

Your service becomes an **identity broker**:
- Accepts both local users and federated logins
- Still issues **your own internal JWTs** trusted across all microservices

### ðŸ”§ Core Deliverables
| Component | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| `ExternalOAuthService` | Handles OIDC code flow and user mapping |
| `/oauth2/**` endpoints | Redirects to external IdPs for authentication |
| Spring Security OAuth2 Client config | Adds support for multiple IdPs |

### ðŸ§© Output
Hybrid authentication flow that supports both platform users and external SSO providers.

---

## ðŸªœ Phase 4 â€” Authorization Server / OIDC

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Promote the service into a **Spring Authorization Server**.

This allows the `auth-service` to issue **OIDC-compliant tokens** for other microservices, replacing any ad-hoc token logic.

### ðŸ”§ Core Deliverables
| Component | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| Spring Authorization Server setup | Enables `/oauth2/token` and `/oauth2/authorize` endpoints |
| Client registration | Configures trusted microservices as OAuth clients |
| JWK endpoint | Publishes signing keys for token verification |

### ðŸ§© Output
A true standards-based authorization server capable of issuing tokens to internal services and APIs.

## ðŸªœ Phase 5 â€” Key Management & Hardening

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Enterprise-grade hardening for security, observability, and resilience.

### ðŸ”§ Core Deliverables
| Component | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| Vault / KMS integration | Key rotation and secret management |
| Actuator metrics | Expose security and login metrics |
| Rate limiting | Protect login endpoints from brute force |
| Advanced password hashing | Argon2 or bcrypt with per-user salt |
| Audit logging | Record security-sensitive events |

### ðŸ§© Output
Production-ready, compliant, and secure identity service meeting enterprise-grade standards.
